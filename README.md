# airportcalc v1.0.1 (21/7/20)
A calculator for airports in minecartrapidtransit

Github: https://github.com/iiiii7d/airportcalc

## Changelog
v1.0.1 (Dinty1): Airport space left should be correct now, thanks :)

## Before using this calculator
1. Open a photo editor eg Pixlr, Photoshop
2. Get a Dynmap screenshot of your city
3. Replace with red (FF0000) your city area, and green (00FF00) your airport space. **Only solid red & green. Colours like FE0000 or 00FF01 will not be detected.**
4. Export your image to an image hosting site, eg Imgur, Discord

## Using this calculator
1. Run the Python script (the only one). Input the url of the image (note: if you're on repl.it, use ctrl+shift+v)
2. It will tell you whether you want measurements in blocks & km^2. Type y or n.
3. If you typed y, input the coordinates, eg. Northern Z coordinate will be what is the Z coordinate at the top of the image on the Dynmap
4. Wait for it to calculate.
5. Profit!
